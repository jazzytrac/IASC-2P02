Reporter: So tell me how this all began? 

Well, ever since I was a kid, I loved watching movies with my dad. I remember spending hours trying to find the movie I wanted to rent for the weekend; at this magical place called Blockbuster. At first, they only sold VHS tapes, but then after a couple of years, they started to come out with DVDs. Each time we went, we choose two movies, one for me and one for my older sister Becca. The problem with Blockbuster was that you could only rent for three days and, if you went over that time, you would get charged. Around once a month, we would get the chance to go to the movie theaters. Cineplex was the place to be on a Friday night. Popcorn, candy, and sprite would be what we would get every time.

As I got older, I started to go there with friends but as a young teen, affording to go to the movies was a struggle. I needed a job, so I decided to apply for Blockbusters. From working there, I was able to get one free movie to rent a month and an extra two days to return them. I would get paid every two weeks and spend half of my money on movies and, the other half I  saved for university. By the time I got to university, my friends and I would take turns buying any new movies we saw at the DVD vending machine in the grocery store. There was way less option to choose from and, most of the time the new ones were sold out but, it was all we had since the town was so small with no around Blockbuster for miles.

In my final year of university, I came up with an idea to start renting out some of my movies and, I called it Rent a Movie. Over the years, I had gathered over 50 movies in my collection and, I figured since most of my friends would borrow them anyways, I would start charging them. I figured out a way to copy them to my computer and place them on burner disks. I started by making three copies of 10 of my favorite movies, sold them for $5 each, and allowed my customers to keep them for a week. I even bought a printer for the cases to make them look more legit. It started great my friends started telling their friends soon, the whole campus knew about it. Around the third week of business, we had problems with people not returning the disks or losing them. That's when I realized I need some muscle and some help copying the disks. First, I hired Guss and Tony, twin brothers I met in the first year that played on the football team. Then I hired my sister Becca since she was good with computers and she needed some money to help pay for her debts from school. Finally, some of my friends, Mila, Johnson, Rick, and Tim, helped with pick-ups and drop-offs. We had five pick-up spots to choose from 2 on-campus and three off-campus. Customers would come with the money and, my employees would come with the movies. If anything got out of hand, either Guss or Tony would be right around the corner keeping watch.   

After doing this for a year, I had graduated from university and had more time to work on my business, and I wanted to expand. Instead of or renting, we started selling them, so we didn’t have to keep track of people anymore. We started by attending flea markets in different city’s each week. We went from renting 100 movies a week for $5 to selling over 1000 movies a day for double the price. Around this time, the police started to get word of what we were doing and raided one of our stands at a  flea market in Hamilton; we each got a $5000 fine. After we got caught, Becca suggested we make a website called Movie Time. Instead of making the physical copies, we would upload them there then people could download them. We realized we could do this anywhere, so we left Canada and moved to America. A couple of months after we moved, the sales on our site started to decrease rapidly. For some reason, DVDs were trending again. We ditched the site and went back to what we knew best. Every couple of months, we switched cities, every couple of years, we went back to Canada. But then, one day in the summer of 2020, it all came crashing down. By this time, the police had been tracking our movements for months, we were wanted in Canada and, the U.S. Becca and I had planned to take one final trip back to Canada to say goodbye to our parents, but the police were waiting for us as soon as our plane landed. I took the blame for everything and, my sister got out with only two years of probation. I got sentenced to 10 years but, I can get out on parole in 2 years with good behavior.

Reporter: Oh wow, that’s quite a story and, I’m sorry I forgot to get your name for the article, what was it again?

Hi, I’m Jane Turner, and this is my story about how I became the biggest millennial bootlegger in North America. See you in 10 years.


## Micro Essay 
The piece of speculative fiction I wrote is about a world where streaming services, such as Netflix or Disney plus, were never invented. It follows the story of how a woman named Jane decided to start a business selling illegal DVDs. This story is supposed to imply that if we did not have streaming services, we would be buying or renting illegal DVDs. Eventually, the punishment for this crime would get more serious, since a lot of people would be doing it. The idea for this story and how it relates to media archaeology is that old media is being new and new media is being old again. As Jussi Parikka writes: "New media might be here and slowly changing our user habits, but old media never left us" this is evident in two parts of the story. First, when Jane rents out her old DVDs from her collection, and second when Jane and her team decide to ditch their website and start selling DVDs again. The Team thought it would be safer to start selling on their website, but they got greedy and wanted more money. Once DVDs started trending, they went back to their roots and ended up getting caught.
